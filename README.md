## Introduction

The solution profiles of dispersive partial differential equations depends heavily on the algebraic properties of time. At rational times with respect to the period, the solution is a piece-wise step function. However, at irrational times with respect to the period, the solution is a continuous, but nowhere differentiable fractal curve. This phenomenon is known as the “Talbot Effect”, which is when the solutions to dispersive PDE exhibit two vastly different behaviours, depending on what time they are calculated.

Since the solution curves at irrational times are very fractal-like, they are quite chaotic and can oscillate very quickly. We can look at the box-dimension of these curves in order to get an idea of how chaotic each solution is.
